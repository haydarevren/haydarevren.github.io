				<p>An interactive web app that allows users to type the flavors/characteristics they find appealing and
					shows five recommended beers and the user's taste profile.</p>

				<span><img src="images/cheers_animation.gif" alt="StockApp" width="100%" /></span>

				<p>I scraped thousands of consumer reviews and manufacture descriptions of their beers. These reviews
					and descriptions are highly informative as they contain words that provide information the
					characteristics of that beer.

					Then I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to uncover relationships between these descriptive
					sentences and beers.

					When the user inputs their own search terms, first algorithm transforms unstructured text data to
					high dimensional vectors. With sentence embedding I can capture the context of the whole sentence in
					a vector.

					It allows us to understand the intention of the sentence.

					Once the search terms vectorized, the algorithm classifies these vectors.

				<span><img src="images/cheers_model.png" alt="StockApp" width="100%" /></span>
				<p>I tried a variety of models for classification task (with and without tranfer learning). You can see
					the performance of them below. Top-5 accuracy means any of our model's top 5 highest probability
					answers match with the expected answer.

				<h4>Clustering and Synchronizing of Audio Sequences</h4>
				<p>For more details on the scientific content of the project,
					see my <a href="https://github.com/haydarevren/Synchronize-Audio">github page</a>.</p>



				<p>For my senior project, I developed an application that synchronizes heavily corrupted multi-audio
					recordings within a few seconds of the core search time using a landmark-based audio fingerprinting
					method in MATLAB.

				</p>

				<span><img src="images/spectrogram_peaks.png" alt="Biases" width="100%" /></span>



				<p>By using FFT over small windows of time in the audio samples, we can create a spectrogram of the
					audio sample. After that , we can find the peaks in amplitude. You can think it as a fingerprint for
					the audio sample. </p>

				<h4>Schooling Aid vs College Attendance</h4>
				<p>For more details on the scientific content of the project,
					see my <a href="/files/DID Research Paper.pdf">paper</a>.</p>



				<p> For the final project of BC's Graduate Level Applied Econometrics course ECON 8823, I examined the
					effect of schooling aid on college attendance. I utilized DID estimator fo the identification. It is
					a useful technique in impact valuation when randomization on the individual level is
					not possible.
				</p>

				<span><img src="images/DIDgraph.png" alt="DID" width="100%" /></span>


				<ul>
					<li>The research question is whether schooling aid increases college attendance or it just
						financially
						supports students who would have gone to college regardless of aid.</li>
					<li>Examining the effect of schooling aid on college attendance is challenging because treated and
						untreated students can differ in unobservable characteristics correlated with potential
						outcomes,
						even controlling for differences in observed characteristics.</li>
					<li>However, we can use a difference-in-differences estimator for identification strategy.
						The Social Security Administration has provided benefits to the children of deceased, disabled,
						and
						retired Social Security beneficiaries until those children are 18.</li>
					<li>Using difference-in-differences analysis, we find that the availability of $1000 of grant
						(normalized to $2856) increases college attendance by 0.167 years and the probability of
						attending
						by 3.8%.</li>

				<h4>Affirmative Action in Two Dimensions: A Multi-Period Apportionment Problem</h4>
				<p>For more details on the content of the project,
					see my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11963">paper</a>.
					Code and data associated with this paper are available on my <a
						href="https://github.com/haydarevren/aa2d">github page</a>. </p>

				<hr>
				<p>

				<p>This project develops an applied algorithm using statistics and graph theory to improve social and
					economic impact.
					Court's objections and public protests in India inspired us to formalize an affirmation action
					issue. We document merit in debated proposals but also faults. We present an alternative solution
					and measure the impact by running
					simulations on 12k jobs. The result of the empirical case study is shown below. </p>

				<span><img src="images/thesis.JPG" alt="thesis" width="100%" /></span>


				<p style="font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace"> Abstract: In many settings affirmative action
					policies apply at two levels simultaneously, for
					instance, at university as well as at its departments. We show that commonly used methods in
					reserving positions for beneficiaries of affirmative action are often inadequate in such settings.
					We present a comprehensive evaluation of existing procedures to formally document their
					shortcomings. We propose a new solution with appealing theoretical properties and quantify the
					benefits of adopting it using recruitment advertisement data from India. </p>

				<p>The solution is built around a network flow algorithm that takes a flow network as input
					and randomly constructs another flow network with fewer fractional flows as its output. By iterative
					application of this algorithm,
					a flow network with integral flows is generated.</p>
